####AI

- What is an AI?
	- People generally use the term Artificial Intelligence.
	- They say when an AI is created. What does that actually mean?
		- What does the "AI" constitute of?
- What is morality to an AI?
	- Three laws of robotics?
	- Judgement?
	- How are we to explain to a robot what is moral and what is not?
		- Do we program this sense of morality into it? 
		- Do we "teach" it morality?
		- Does it matter if it becomes immoral? Does this make it more humanistic?
- If we're modelling an AI after us, what are the downfalls?
	- What could go wrong? What are problems with us?
	- There are problems in fields in Computer Vision where when we try model how we see things we run into problems where our artificial-eye now gets tricked by illusions the same way as us.
		- Is this okay?
	- Is it acceptable for an AI to be just like us? Is our expectation for it to be smarter, and better than us?
	- It takes a while for us to learn how to do simple things such as walk, talk, etc. 
		- Do we give the same liberty to robots/AI we build and allow them the same time period?
	- The central idea is if we're literally trying to create another version of us.
- What is it for an AI to be intelligent?
	- Should it just know things? 
	- How should it understand these things?
- Should an AI be programmed once? Or should it be capable or re-writing itself? 
- How should it differenciate between reality and not? 

####Machine Learning

- Can there be a single-learning algorithm to learn everything?
	- Same algorithm to learn how to play basketball as there is to learn math.
	- Mountcastle's theory & Jeff Hawkins' Framework
	- Reference my Gallatin Quantification Papers (2) for this issue?
- How can we define intelligence, and then quantify it?
	- Do we need to define something in order to quantify it, or do we quantify it by defining it? OR do we allow it to be quantified when we define it.

####Materials

- What are basic blocks that can be improved to make peoples lives better?
	- Shelter: Wood, Metal
		- Drainage: Sewage system
		- Heat, Warmth, Light: Electricity & Electronics
	- Intake: Water, Food

####First law of thermodynamics

"The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but cannot be created or destroyed."

- Every piece, every particle of you and me now was a part of something else before, and will be a part of something else in the future. There's something profoundly beautiful about that - you are just a being that can into existence by chance or by some event occuring, and every part of you is borrowed or existed somewhere else before. During your life your particles are exchanged by you drinking things, and as your skin sheds. After your death you purely become a part of something else - you are turned into something completely new, broken up into pieces, and you truly become new. 

####History

History never remembers things that don't happen. Examples could be things that someone sacrifies themselves to stop - we never rememmber these individuals.

####Natural Selection

- "Natural selection does not maximize happiness or even well-being, but rather long-term reproductive success."
	- Pagel, Mark (2012-02-27). Wired for Culture: Origins of the Human Social Mind (p. 24). W. W. Norton & Company. Kindle Edition. 
- "How did humans become self-aware?"
- "How can evolution account for the human mind?" 
- "How do scientists explain things like language, that do not occur anywhere else in the animal world?"

####Design/Feedback loop

- Always get input in things that you are doing & learning. Show them what you're doing and then critically ask quesitons.

#### TED Talks

- There is no Critical discourse
- There's no discussion. It is an assertment they make from their research

#### Analysis

- Is there are correlation between sentiments of tweets given a news article, and the sentiment of the news article title itself. So if we score a sentiment for the title - would there be a relationship between that and the sentiments of the tweets.
	- For a sad title - would the things people tweet out be sad?
